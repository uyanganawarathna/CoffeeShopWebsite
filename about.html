		At vinod's Coffee,
		 community includes all of us ... wherever we live, work, rest, and play. Our similarities outweigh our differences and our belief is that we can build community one cup at a time, whether here in the Southwest, with you our customers, and across the globe in the farm communities that produce our delicious coffee beans.

But we are more than just a coffee fix, we have a vision to serve and educate through scholarships and training programs in both barista training and roasting; giving the opportunity to elevate youth and the underprivileged with life changing skills and opportunities. 

 Connect with us in person at one of our local Coffee Tasting Events in the Phoenix area.  Follow us on Facebook or Instagram for the next tasting event.


<h2>OUR COMMITMENT TO GREAT COFFEE</h2>

Taste:  We are committed to crafting you excellent roasted whole bean coffee delivered fresh.  We roast our coffees in a fluid bed roaster in small batches using traditional sight, smell, sound, & a bit of technology to craft flavor. 

Health & Environment:  Our Coffee is roasted in an environmentally friendly manner while burning no fossil fuels.  We use only clean, hydroelectricity generated here in the Southwest leaving a minimal carbon footprint.

Sourcing our Beans:  We are committed to bringing you responsibly sourced, high quality arabica beans.  This is based on a commitment to our growers & their communities</p>
